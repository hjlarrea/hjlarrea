# Welcome to My GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Hernan, a Technical Product Manager with a strong focus on building platforms and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) offerings. My journey in the IT world has been shaped by a deep background in Infrastructure, with a particular expertise in cloud providers â€”especially Azureâ€” and automation using Python and PowerShell.

Over the years, I've cultivated a passion for technologies like Python, Kubernetes, and Docker, which I enthusiastically leverage to build and optimize platforms. My experience spans over a decade, during which I've specialized in IT-related products, driving innovation and efficiency through platform engineering and DevOps adoption.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you'll find projects that reflect my interests and expertise in these technologies. I'm always open to collaboration and discussions, so don't hesitate to reach out!
